title:	"PCA on Climate Data"

  If you’ve followed my previous posts to this point, then you know that I’m basically just building my own version of [this](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/61a5d4e9494f46c2b520a984b2398f3b) to understand different climate regions across the world. The instructions on how to do it are in the paper and the instructions don’t mention anything about doing PCA so what am I doing here? While I understand that the paper just stratifies the mean temperature to get a region breakdown, which I will probably end up doing too at some point, I feel like there’s more to express from the [bioclimate variables](https://www.worldclim.org/data/bioclim.html) from [WorldClim](https://www.worldclim.org/) than just the annual mean temperature.

## Temperature vs Seasons

One thing the ArcGIS [map](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/61a5d4e9494f46c2b520a984b2398f3b) doesn’t cover that this Köppen [map](http://www.gloh2o.org/koppen/) does is a sense of seasons. This is obviously a major difference in climates to the human experience as well. Seasons are mostly a result of how the Earth orbits the Sun, where the Sun’s intensity on a given area of Earth can (not always) vary with the time of the year.

For example, we bank on the more stable climate of the tropic regions close to the equator as an escape from the more temperate (read: temperamental) latitudes where seasons can be painful. The climate near the equator is more stable because it experiences less variance in the angle of the sun.
