The posts are mainly for my benefit: writing helps me organize my thoughts, re-reading posts helps me context switch, and the projects I build are for fun. The work is published here on the off-chance that any of it might be useful to others (and also for interviewers to stalk me).

As such, I'm not an expert on anything here -- absolute novice -- so expect some errors and send pull requests with corrections.
